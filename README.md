# Chess System Project

This Chess System Project was first architected by @acenelio and then modified to be even closer to a complete chess game.

*You need to run with a terminal that supports colors.

## Improvements

4 ways to draw - (Draw by Insufficient Material, Draw by Stalemate, Draw by Fifty-Move Rule and Draw by Threefold Repetition).

Algebraic notation - (Chess Notation).
